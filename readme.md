# Mesh Viewer

Simple mesh viewer for both iOS and MacOS, written in Swift and Metal.

### Improvements

This uses SwiftUI, currently [workaround is needed for MetalKit](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/119112). Watch SwiftUI development, when MetalKit becomes integrated, update this project.
